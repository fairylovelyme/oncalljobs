•	Initial stage<br>
•	<h3>Commercial stage</h3><br>
•	<h2>Top rated stage</h2> <br>
•	We seek to empower top performing Sellers with helpful tools to grow their business.<br>
 Sellers who invest in self-promotion may achieve greater customer satisfaction.<br>
  And, if they deliver on time and maintain high quality and ratings, ONCALLJOBS may reward them with new statuses, <br>

•	Sellers who cannot maintain their high quality service, experience a severe drop in ratings,<br>
 or stop delivering on time risk losing their Seller status and the benefits that come with it. For example,<br>
  late deliveries, warnings to the Seller’s account and cancellations can cause a Seller to move to a different Level.<br>
•	Advanced levels provide their owners with additional benefits, including offering Services for higher prices through Extras, or selling their services in multiples.
•<h1>	Top Rated Sellers</h1> <br>
•	Top Rated Sellers are chosen manually by Oncalljob editors through an ongoing review process based on seniority,<br>
 volume of sales, extremely high ratings, exceptional customer care, high order completion rate and community leadership.<br>
  Top Rated Sellers gain access to more extensive features than previous levels, <br>
  including exclusive access to beta features and VIP support.<br>
•	The status of being top rated does not mean that it is going to be there no matter what the seller do. Our Oncalljob customer care team is constantly evaluating the ratings and reviews customer receives from the sellers. A TOP RATED seller can come to the initial position or can be suspended if there is sudden drop in ratings or complaints popping up from customers or frequent cancellation of orders. And a seller can also be suspended if he or she violates our Oncalljob terms of service and policies.<br>
•	<h2>Pro Sellers</h2> <br>
•<strong>	Pro Sellers are sellers who purchase their pro status but the status of pro sellers is not easily granted to them. Our Oncalljob team evaluate their skills and talents and also their experience level and maintain certain quality standards and if the seller meat all these requirements then he or she can purchase their pro-seller status. And purchasing this status does not mean that they are free to do anything if they violate our laws, or there is frequent cancellation of orders or feuds with their buyers or sudden drop in good ratings then our Oncalljob team evaluate their performance and take this status away from them.
